The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive driver training and testing platform for students preparing for DMV exams. The client, DriverPass, needed a system that integrated online learning with hands-on lessons, offering features like account management, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and administrative tools for staff. The system was designed to be web-based, secure, and accessible across multiple devices. A key strength of the project was the careful consideration of both functional and nonfunctional requirements, ensuring reliability and user-friendliness. If I could revise one aspect, I would enhance the reporting and analytics features, incorporating more advanced tools to provide deeper insights into student performance and operational efficiency. Interpreting the user’s needs was central to the design process, ensuring the platform was relevant and effective for its users. In future projects, I would continue to prioritize user needs, employing iterative design and user feedback to refine system requirements while leveraging modern tools and methodologies for adaptable systems​.
